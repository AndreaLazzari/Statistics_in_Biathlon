Carried out with:
- [Tommaso Amico](https://github.com/tommasoamico)

## Overview
A Bayesian statistic analysis with R is performed on the biathlon word cup, starting from the 2014 season.
In the R-code directory we can find the R-markdowns where the actual code was developed.

The code for a dashboard built with dash is instead located in the dashboard directory.

The **Project PDF** document contains a brief recap of the analysis written in LaTeX - [Project](Biathlon_analysis.pdf).
