# Statistics in Biathlon
Final project of the course of Advanced Statistics for Physical Analysis - Year 2021/22

## Overview
A Bayesian statistic analysis with R is performed on the biathlon word cup, starting from the 2014 season.
In the R-code directory we can find the R-markdowns where the actual code was developed.

The code for a dashboard built with dash is instead located in the dashboard directory.
The **Project PDF: [Project](Biathlon_analysis.pdf)** document contains a brief recap of the analysis written in LaTeX.
